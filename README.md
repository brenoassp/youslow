YouSlow is designed to monitor YouTube buffering events while users watch YouTube videos on Chrome browsers, iOS and Android mobile devices. Our monitoring system collects and marks reported data on Google map, then calculates statistics in terms of an Internet service provider (ISP), buffering duration and location.

There are many approaches to measure user-perceived video quality. Most of work focus more on analyzing HTTP/TCP packets (e.g., video packet loss rate, delay and throughput) from the network operator’s point of view. These quality-of-service (QoS) metrics typically show the impact on video quality, but does not represent the user-perceived video quality.

In order to address the problem, YouSlow collects buffering events directly from the video players on end-users’ devices. Through our website, you can compare your buffering frequency with your neighbors and the world on our web site. For example, if your neighbor uses a different ISP from you and reports less buffering events with YouSlow, you can check what ISPs they are using to see the best ISP choice in your area. If you are a network operator, you may monitor real-time buffering events and find Internet service performance from our web site.

YouSlow only collects information of your buffering duration (in seconds), your approximate location (e.g., country and region), the time and date of your buffering event and the ISP you are using. No other data is collected such as what videos you are watching or your YouTube account information.
